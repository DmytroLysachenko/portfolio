        My professional journey began in the maritime industry, where I
        developed a strong foundation in discipline, responsibility, and
        structured problem-solving. I earned a Master’s degree in Navigation of
        Seagoing Ships from National University ‘Odesa Maritime Academy’
        (2015–2021), specializing in vessel operations, logistics, and safety
        management.

      <p>
        While pursuing my degree, I started working as a Deck Cadet aboard
        container ships, gaining early exposure to high-responsibility
        environments. After graduation, I advanced to Third Officer, serving for
        five years. In this role, I was responsible for navigation watchkeeping,
        cargo operations, vessel safety, and compliance with international
        maritime regulations. Working in mixed international crews throughout my
        maritime career significantly improved my English communication skills
        and adaptability in multicultural environments. These experiences helped
        shape my analytical thinking, time management, and structured approach
        to problem-solving—skills that seamlessly translate into the world of
        software development.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Transition to Software Development</h3>

      <p>
        Despite my successful maritime career, I developed a strong interest in
        technology and software engineering. Determined to shift into a field
        where I could build and create, I enrolled in the GOIT Full-Stack
        Development program, where I learned JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js,
        and Node.js. However, my learning extended far beyond the structured
        curriculum. While the course provided a solid foundation, I took it upon
        myself to independently explore and master additional technologies,
        including Next.js, Astro, React Native, Expo, and modern frontend
        frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after completing my training, I joined StarNavi as a React
        Developer (Aug 2024 – Nov 2024). I worked on a SaaS web application,
        contributing to the development of scalable and efficient user
        interfaces using TypeScript, Next.js, Astro, Chakra UI, and TanStack
        Query.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I gained valuable hands-on experience in a professional setting, I
        ultimately decided to resign to expand my expertise further and focus on
        building projects that showcase my full capabilities as a developer.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Continuous Learning & Technical Growth</h3>

      <p>
        Since resigning from StarNavi, I have been fully committed to improving
        my coding skills, dedicating time every single day to writing code,
        exploring new technologies, and refining best practices—a commitment
        visibly reflected in my GitHub activity. My personal projects serve as
        proof of my self-motivation and ability to learn independently, as I
        actively incorporate new concepts, improve code scalability, and adopt
        best engineering practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I am also focused on adapting to the European
        job market by actively learning Polish and continuously improving my
        English proficiency. I have obtained a <a

        >, which is linked on my LinkedIn profile, further demonstrating my
        commitment to effective communication in international teams.

      <p>
        With a strong foundation in frontend and full-stack development, a
        proven ability to learn independently, and a structured, disciplined
        approach to problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to innovative
        projects. I thrive in team environments, enjoy tackling complex
        challenges, and am always pushing myself to grow as a developer.
