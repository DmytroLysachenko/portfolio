        My professional journey began in the maritime industry, where I
        developed a strong foundation in discipline, responsibility, and
        structured problem-solving. I earned a Master’s degree in Navigation of
        Seagoing Ships from National University ‘Odesa Maritime Academy’
        (2015-2021), specializing in vessel operations, logistics, and safety
        management.
      </p>

      <p>
        While pursuing my degree, I started working as a Deck Cadet aboard
        container ships, gaining early exposure to high-responsibility
        environments. After graduation, I advanced to Third Officer, serving for
        five years. In this role, I was responsible for navigation watchkeeping,
        cargo operations, vessel safety, and compliance with international
        maritime regulations. Working in mixed international crews throughout my
        maritime career significantly improved my English communication skills
        and adaptability in multicultural environments. These experiences helped
        shape my analytical thinking, time management, and structured approach
        to problem-solving—skills that seamlessly translate into the world of
        software development.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Transition to Software Development</h3>

      <p>
        After a successful maritime career, I discovered a growing passion for
        technology and software engineering. Determined to build a new path, I
        enrolled in the GOIT Full-Stack Development program, where I gained a
        solid foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Node.js.
        Beyond the structured curriculum, I pushed myself to explore modern
        tools and frameworks independently, including Next.js, Astro, React
        Native, and Expo, which allowed me to broaden my perspective and
        experiment with building complete applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after completing the program, I joined StarNavi as a React
        Developer (Aug 2024 - Nov 2024). There, I contributed to a SaaS web
        application, helping to deliver scalable and efficient user interfaces
        with TypeScript, Next.js, Astro, Chakra UI, and TanStack Query. This
        experience gave me valuable insight into working within a professional
        team and applying modern frontend practices in a real product
        environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        After my time at StarNavi, I chose to focus on expanding my expertise
        even further. I dedicate significant time to personal projects and
        advanced learning in backend development and AI, while also actively
        improving my Polish and refining my English skills. By combining
        continuous technical growth with language learning, I aim to bring
        well-rounded, valuable skills to the European job market and strengthen
        my profile as a full-stack developer.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Continuous Learning & Technical Growth</h3>

      <p>
        Since resigning from StarNavi, I have been fully committed to improving
        my coding skills. Every day, I dedicate time to writing code, exploring
        new technologies, and refining best practices. This consistent effort is
        clearly reflected in my GitHub activity. My personal projects
        demonstrate my self-motivation and ability to learn independently, as I
        incorporate new concepts, improve code scalability, and adopt best
        engineering practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning is at the heart of my journey as a developer. I am completing
        the Microsoft Backend Developer track on Coursera to refine my skills
        with C# and .NET while as well strengthening my foundation in algorithms
        and data structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I actively explore LLMs, agentic AI, and AI-assisted
        workflows to make my development process smarter and more effective.
        Courses such as Google’s Umiejętności Jutra 2.0 and IBM’s Generative AI
        for Software Developers have given me practical tools I already apply in
        my projects, from faster prototyping to more efficient problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuous learning for me extends beyond technology. I am actively
        adapting to the European job market by learning Polish and refining my
        English skills. I hold a

          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >C2-level EF SET certificate</a
        >, also featured on my LinkedIn profile, which demonstrates my
        commitment to effective communication in international teams.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Looking Ahead</h3>

      <p>
        With a strong foundation in frontend and full-stack development, a
        proven ability to learn independently, and a structured, disciplined
        approach to problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to innovative
        projects. I thrive in team environments, enjoy tackling complex
        challenges, and am always pushing myself to grow as a developer.
