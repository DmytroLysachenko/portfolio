        React Developer | Aug 2024 - Nov 2024 | StarNavi
      </h3>
      <p>
        As a React Developer at StarNavi, I worked on a SaaS web application
        with a Markdown-based content editor, user dashboards, and SEO-friendly
        public-facing pages. My main tasks included building new features,
        improving existing ones, and maintaining clean, well-structured code by
        following team coding standards like KISS, DRY, and SOLID.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the public-facing side, I created responsive and SEO-optimized pages
        using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and React, with support for server-side
        rendering and dynamic metadata. In the dashboard, I used TypeScript,
        React, Next.js, Chakra UI, and TanStack Query to build and integrate new
        components, manage application state, and connect with backend APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked closely with frontend and backend developers, QA engineers, and
        the project manager as part of an Agile team. We held daily stand-ups,
        planned sprints in Jira, and reviewed each otherâ€™s code through pull
        requests. I also helped debug and test features before release, working
        directly with QA to ensure smooth delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the project, I focused on writing reusable and scalable
        components, following React best practices such as custom hooks,
        compound components, and higher-order components to keep the codebase
        modular and easy to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>Key Achievements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed SEO-optimized public pages using Next.js and Astro,
          implementing server-side rendering, dynamic metadata generation, and
          structured data markup to maximize search engine visibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a standalone project boilerplate by abstracting and
          modularizing core logic from the main SaaS codebase, enabling faster
          onboarding and development of new features with shared architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built a dashboard widget displaying dynamic user-specific data,
          tightly integrated with TanStack Query for state synchronization,
          caching, and real-time data mutation.
        </li>
      </ul>
