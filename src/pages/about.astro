        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
        <div class="content list">
          <p>
            My journey into technology began with a structured and disciplined
            career in maritime navigation. I earned a Master’s degree in
            Navigation of Seagoing Ships from National University ‘Odesa
            Maritime Academy’ (2015–2021), specializing in vessel operations,
            logistics, and safety management.
          </p>
          <p>
            While pursuing my degree, I gained hands-on industry experience as a
            Deck Cadet aboard container ships. Upon graduation, I advanced to
            Third Officer, serving for five years in a role that demanded
            precision, time management, situational awareness, and
            problem-solving—skills that translate well into software
            development. As a Third Officer, I was responsible for navigation
            watchkeeping, cargo operations, and vessel safety, all of which
            required attention to detail, structured thinking, and adaptability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite excelling in my maritime career, I developed a growing
            passion for technology and software development. Determined to make
            a career transition, I enrolled in the GOIT Full-Stack Development
            program, where I gained expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript,
            React.js, and Node.js. Through intensive training and hands-on
            projects, I built a strong foundation in modern web development.
            <p>
              Shortly after completing my training, I joined StarNavi as a
              Junior React Frontend Developer (Aug 2024 – Dec 2024), working on
              a SaaS web application with a modern tech stack, including
              TypeScript, Next.js, Astro, Chakra UI, and TanStack Query. My
              contributions included:\n- Implementing responsive and
              maintainable UI components\n- Managing data fetching and state
              synchronization with TanStack Query\n- Ensuring performance
              optimization and smooth user experience\n- Collaborating with the
              team to integrate design specifications from Figma into a fully
              functional product
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by my passion for continuous learning and self-improvement,
              I now dedicate my time to building personal projects, exploring
              new technologies, and expanding my expertise in full-stack
              development. I am eager to take on new challenges, contribute to
              innovative projects, and grow as a developer in a dynamic and
              collaborative environment.
