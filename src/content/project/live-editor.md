> #### Challenges & Learning Experiences

##### Implementing Liveblocks for Real-Time Collaboration

- **Problem**: Enabling seamless real-time collaboration with minimal latency.
- **Solution**: Integrated **Liveblocks**, allowing multi-user editing, live presence tracking, notifications, and document versioning. This was my first time working with **Liveblocks**, and it provided deep insights into managing WebSocket connections and optimizing real-time data synchronization.

##### Using Lexical as a Rich-Text Editor

- **Problem**: Finding a lightweight yet powerful editor that supports real-time collaboration.
- **Solution**: Implemented **Lexical**, a modular text editor optimized for performance. This required learning its API to support custom formatting, rich-text features, and integration with **Liveblocks** for real-time updates.

##### Authentication & Role-Based Access with Clerk

- **Problem**: Managing user authentication and controlling access to shared documents.
- **Solution**: Used **Clerk** to implement a secure, scalable authentication system, enabling users to sign in, invite collaborators, and control document permissions dynamically.

##### Handling Notifications & User Activity Tracking

- **Problem**: Keeping users informed about document updates, new comments, and mentions.
- **Solution**: Leveraged **Liveblocksâ€™ notification system** to implement real-time alerts for document changes and user interactions, ensuring an engaging collaboration experience.

##### Error Handling and Performance Monitoring

- **Problem**: Ensuring application stability during collaborative sessions, especially with multiple users.
- **Solution**: Integrated **Sentry** for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring, helping identify issues and optimize the app for a smooth user experience.

> #### Conclusion

**LiveEditor** was an exciting project that helped me deepen my expertise in **real-time collaboration**, **WebSockets**, and building high-performance, interactive web applications. Learning and implementing **Liveblocks** for live editing, **Lexical** for text processing, and **Clerk** for authentication expanded my technical skill set in building collaborative platforms.

Future improvements include:

- Enhanced commenting and threaded discussions with richer media support
- Integrating version control systems (e.g., Git-style) for document edits
- Introducing notifications for comments and document changes
